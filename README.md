## How do I approach designing software?

  Designing software is often a problem solving puzzle. When given a set of requirements or features, the process of implementing these requirements or features is about   figuring out an effective way to reach a solution.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

  With no prior experience using OpenGL, much of what was in the final product was new information gathered over the course. I focused primarily on lighting in this project, and trying to recreater a scene with something resembling a bit more of a realistic lighting.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

  Much of the process I used was simply testing, by making small adjustments and implementing them until I found something I liked, or fit the requirements.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  I think whether one is working on something visual, like graphic design or rendering, or simply coding in general, testing and making small adjustments is applicable. It is important to not do too much without making sure those small adjustments are functional. Otherwise, one could run into issues and not be ewntirely certain how they came to be.

## How do I approach developing programs?

  I typically like to implement a simple or efficient approach, and try to eliminate bugs or mistakes as I go with small changes and tests.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

  Lighting was a major portion of my strategy. I had originally intended to have a smaller scene, relatively speaking, and focus primarily on one object within the scene. But I decided to move outward and expand this idea to an entire room, and focus on implementing objects in that room with varying lighting.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

  Iteration helps to ensure the code is readable and easier to work with. Having the code broken down into smaller parts allows one to work with specific portions of the code more efficiently.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

  My original milestones were a bit simpler and were focused more on a specific object, rather than a whole room as the scene. I felt this was a good decision, as it worked more towards my interesting in lighting, and implmenting a somewhat realistic room, with lighting adjusted for each object.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  My long term goals, beyond my academic goals, are to work in software engineering and development. I've always been fascinated with technology, and a bit of a computer nerd, so I've always felt like this direction would suit me. I've never worked with visual related design, so this course has been a very new experience for me. I feel any new information is valuable information, and knowing more about the field and the various aspects can only open new doors.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

  Graphic design is something I had only tinkered with in the past, and using engines designed for this purpose. I had never worked with graphic design building a project from scratch. This new information will benefit future courses where this informatiion may apply.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

  Similarly to my academic career, this information could be valuable where visual and graphic design is applicable in the professional field.
